# Paws & Preferences 🐾

A fun web application to discover which cats or kittens you like! Swipe right for **“Like”** and left for **“Dislike”**, just like a dating app for cats.

## Features

- Swipe cards with cat pictures on **mobile devices**  
- Use **arrow keys** on desktop/laptop for liking or disliking  
- Full-page pop-up showing **LIKE ❤️** or **DISLIKE ❌**  
- Summary of liked cats appears in the **same spot** after finishing all swipes  
- **Restart** button to play again  
- Dark theme with smooth animations  
- Cat images sourced from [Cataas](https://cataas.com/)

## How to Use

1. Open the webpage in your **browser** (mobile or desktop).  
2. Swipe **right** to like a cat, **left** to dislike it.  
   - On desktop, press **→** for like and **←** for dislike.  
3. After swiping all cats, a **summary** will appear in the same area showing all cats you liked.  
4. Click the **Restart** button to start swiping again.

## How It Works

- Uses **JavaScript** to load cat images and handle swipes.  
- **Touch events** handle mobile swiping.  
- **Keyboard events** handle desktop arrow key swipes.  
- Summary dynamically shows liked cats **without leaving the page**.
